# Resume Generator

## Overview
A resume is a quick outline of an individual's experiences and skills for employers to understand a candidate's abilities. Making a resume these days is quite difficult, so with this program you should just be able to input your information and allow the program to generate it into a LaTeX file. 

## Features
- GUI for inputting information (education, work experience, skills, etc.)
- Google Speech API to input information for individuals unable to
- Finally choosing between multiple themes and customising the fonts to your own choosing

## First Checkpoint
For the first checkpoint I'll demo the initial windows which ask the user for information via text or Speech. The information should output to a simple file.

## Libraries
- MikTex
- Speech Recognition
- Tkinter

## Why this is an 'A' project
- Allows individuals to create a quick base resume to get them started
- Speech input allows for handicapped users to be able to utilize the program and also create a resume
- Uses Python to generate editable LaTeX and PDF files.
